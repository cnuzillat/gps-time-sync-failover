# GPS Time Sync Failover

An embedded time synchronization system designed for a Raspberry Pi that acquires precise UTC time from a GPS receiver and automatically switches to a backup time source during GPS outages. The project features real-time monitoring, event logging, and a web-based dashboard to visualize system status and uptime. This project demonstrates reliable timekeeping for aerospace and defense applications where accurate timing is critical.

## Features

- **GPS-based Time Synchronization**: Retrieves precise UTC time from a GPS receiver (VK-172 USB dongle).  
- **Failover to RTC**: Uses a DS3231 Real-Time Clock module as a backup when GPS signal is lost.  
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Displays system status, current coordinates, and time accuracy.  
- **Event Logging**: Logs time sync events, GPS fixes, and failover actions for analysis.  
- **Web-based Dashboard (future)**: Planned interface to visualize uptime and system metrics.

## Project Objectives

1. Implement a robust GPS time acquisition system in C, interfacing with `gpsd`.
2. Understand and handle NMEA sentence parsing and GPS data structures. 
3. Implement a failover timekeeping system using a DS3231 RTC module.
4. Demonstrate embedded development practices for aerospace-grade reliability and precision.

## Relevance to Aerospace

Accurate and redundant timekeeping is foundational for aerospace systems, including:

- Avionics and flight control synchronization
- Satellite communication timing
- Logging and telemetry alignment
- Fault-tolerant mission systems

This project demonstrates how precise UTC synchronization can be achieved using open-source software and commodity hardware in embedded environments.

## Progress

Progress is tracked in [`progress.md`](progress.md)

As of the most recent update:
- Successfully installed and configured `gpsd` and `gpsd-clients`.
- Verified detection of VK-172 GPS dongle via `/dev/ttyACM0`.
- Observed satellite lock and fix data using `cgps -s`.
- Developed an initial C program (`gps_time.c`) that:
  - Connects to `gpsd`
  - Reads GPS fix data
  - Outputs current UTC time once per second
- Testing showed stable 3D DGPS fix with 5â€“6 satellites in use.

## Getting Started

1. Prepare Raaspberry Pi
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install gpsd gpsd-clients
```
2. Connect GPS Device
   - Plug the VK-172 GPS dongle into a USB port.
   - Verify detection:
  ```bash
lsusb
ls /dev/ttyACM*
```   
3. Start gpsd
```bash
sudo systemctl stop gpsd.socket gpsd
sudo gpsd /dev/ttyACM0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
```
4. Run the C Program
```bash
gcc gps_time.c -o gps_time -lgps
./gps_time
```

## Next Steps

- Improve GPS parsing and validation logic in C.
- Add support for DS3231 RTC as a backup time source.
- Implement logging of time synchronization events.
- Capture and document GPS output screenshots and hardware setup images.
- Develop the planned web dashboard for real-time status visualization.
